# Political Revolution Website Developer Installation Guide

This file describes the steps needed to install a working developer environment on your local machine so you can begin contributing to the Political Revolution website. If you encounter any problems during the setup process, check our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/politicalrev/political-revolution.com/blob/master/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

1. **Install Docker Engine.** The local development server is entirely assembled using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so this is the only prerequisite for theme development. Installation is straightforward on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/). Once it's installed, open up your preferred terminal (git bash on Windows).

2. **Clone the code into your directory of choice:** 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/politicalrev/political-revolution.com.git
  ```

2. **Set up the local server:** 

  ```
  cd political-revolution.com && cp .env.example .env && docker-compose up
  ```

  First, we [copy the example environment configuration](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/environment-variables/) (which has already been configured to work with our local dev environment) to a local, untracked .env file. Docker will then create virtual containers which emulate our production server environment. On your console you will see the output of these containers. 
  
  The first time you run this command, it will take several minutes to complete as it downloads all the dependencies the local server needs, imorts our database into the `db/` folder, and starts up the server. Go grab a cup-a-joe. Running `docker-compose up` in the future will go much faster, as the dependencies are already installed. The installation is complete when you see:

  ```
  build_1      | [BS] Proxying: http://prdev.com
  build_1      | [BS] Access URLs:
  build_1      |  -----------------------------------
  build_1      |        Local: http://localhost:8083
  build_1      |     External: http://172.19.0.3:8083
  build_1      |  -----------------------------------
  build_1      |           UI: http://localhost:3001
  build_1      |  UI External: http://172.19.0.3:3001
  build_1      |  -----------------------------------
  build_1      | [BS] Watching files...
  ```

3. **Point the domain `prdev.com` at your local machine.** This is to get [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) working with Docker, and is totally worth it. You can do this manually by adding the line `127.0.0.1 prdev.com` to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Unix, `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows). If you are on Unix, running `./server/addhost.sh` from the root of the repo will do this for you.

4. **Navigate to `prdev.com:8083`, you're ready to go!** You should see a near-exact copy of the PR website. Browsersync will automatically inject any changes you make into the page when you save a file.

To attach to the terminal of the database, server, or build, you may run `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`, but you shouldn't need to.

To stop the local server, just hit `ctrl + c` from the terminal window `docker-compose` is running in and it will stop your containers.
