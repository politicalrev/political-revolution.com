* [Bower](http://bower.io/) for front-end package management
* [asset-builder](https://github.com/austinpray/asset-builder) for the JSON file based asset pipeline
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Theme wrapper](https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-wrapper/)
* ARIA roles and microformats
* Posts use the [hNews](http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews) microformat

See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

## Theme installation

Install Sage by copying the project into a new folder within your WordPress themes directory.

Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) has been installed before moving on.

Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/themes/
$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name 8.5.0
```

## Theme setup

Edit `lib/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install gulp and Bower

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/manifest.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `http://project-name.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://project-name.dev"
  }
...
```
If your local development URL looks like `http://localhost:8888/project-name/` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:8888/project-name/"
  }
...
```
