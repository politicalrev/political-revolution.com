Welcome to the Github repository for the website of [Political Revolution](https://political-revolution.com/about).
It is built upon the [Bedrock WordPress boilerplate](https://roots.io/bedrock/) and the
[Sage starter theme](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/latest).

Political Revolution is an all-volunteer organization which works to promote progressive values through digital activism.
This website, as with all our efforts, is completely built on and reliant on contributions from people like you. Here's
how to join the fight:

1. Follow [this guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) to get our preconfigured developer environment set up on your computer.

2. Check out the [open issues](https://github.com/politicalrev/political-revolution.com/issues) to see what needs doing
right now. Issues marked with a "Ready" label in particular are ready to be worked on, and in-progress work is marked as
"In Progress" and have an branch with their issue number attached. When you find something you want to tackle, drop a
comment and let us know you're getting started. Note: if you make a couple contributions, you may request write access
to the repo from @smona.

3. Join the PR conversation on Slack. That's where all discussion and planning for our projects take place. Go to our
[volunteer page](https://political-revolution.com/volunteer/) and click the big red button to join.
